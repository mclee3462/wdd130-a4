        <p>I am hoping to learn more about web development so that I can better assist those who are in need of a website.
            I also know that AWS and fire base touch on web development so if I master it here, I can better use those applications
            The hope is that I can improve my HTML and CSS skills to become a better asset to those who want to hire me in the future.</p>
